'Gjallarhorn' generation introduces asynchronous operations. Those are designed to provide non blocking operations on your storage. 

### The basic idea

In general, any asynchronous operation separates content and a task. To perform any read/write operation three types of objects are required: 

 * **content** which holds the data and might be any GObject derived object, which properties are the simplest and volatile storage
 * **job** which represents single operation and is responsible to map content data to underlying storage 
 * **pool** which executes operations

Default implementation provides execution pool based on threads. Once job has content assigned, it can be added to such pool, which executes job in separate thread. As soon as operations succeeds, proper signal is emitted and all callbacks which are connected to such signal are invoked.

### Basic example

    def executionCallback(self, obj, arg):
        print "ASYNC OPERATION IS DONE"
    
    obj = Midgard.Object.factory(cnc, "TheType", None)
    ref = Midgard.ObjectReference(id = 123, name = "id")
    job = Midgard.SqlContentManagerJobLoad(connection = cnc, contentobject = obj, reference = ref)
    
    pool = Midgard.ExecutionPool(max_n_threads = 2)
    job.connect("execution-end", executionCallbac, None)
    pool.push(self.job)
    
    loop = GLib.MainLoop()
    loop.run()
