title: Inline AJAX editing
---
MidCOM has the capability of supporting inline editing of content with its so-called _Ajax Editor_. This will make all content shown on pages editable when user _double clicks_ it. The DOM element containing that piece of content turns into a form element, with the necessary _Save_, _Preview_ and _Cancel_ buttons.

AJAX editing can be enabled in site's MidCOM configuration (`code-init` element) with:

    $GLOBALS['midcom_config_local']['enable_ajax_editing'] = true;

## AJAX editing and Suhosin

Since the AJAX editing feature uses quite long HTTP query parameters, it doesn't work by default with the PHP [Suhosin](http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/) security extension enabled. To make it work, edit your `php.ini`:

    suhosin.get.max_name_length = 128
    suhosin.request.max_varname_length = 128
