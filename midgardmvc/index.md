Midgard MVC is a web framework for PHP. Being a framework, it provides a standard way to build and deploy web applications. Your applications provide a set of interfaces that Midgard MVC calls when a matching HTTP request is made.

For serving the HTTP requests, Midgard MVC uses [an application server](http://github.com/indeyets/appserver-in-php/wiki) written in PHP. This allows for persistence and advanced caching on the PHP level.

Midgard MVC can be used with the [Midgard2](/midgard2/) Content Repository, but it also works without it.
