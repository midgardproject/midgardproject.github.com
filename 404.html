    <p>It appears the page you're looking for is no longer available on this site. We did a major site reorganization in May 2012, and it may have gone together with that.</p>
    <p>Our apologies, we know this is <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html">bad practice</a>. But so much of the old site contents were simply obsolete that it was better to start mostly fresh.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Our current content is organized around products:</p>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/midcom/">MidCOM PHP framework</a></li>
      <li><a href="/midgardmvc/">Midgard MVC PHP framework</a></li>
      <li><a href="/midgard1/">Midgard1 Content Repository</a></li>
      <li><a href="/midgard2/">Midgard2 Content Repository</a></li>
      <li><a href="/phpcr/">Midgard2 PHPCR provider</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
  <p>You may also find the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110722055051/http://www.midgard-project.org/">archived version of the old site</a> useful.
