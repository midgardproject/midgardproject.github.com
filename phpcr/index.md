A [Midgard2](/midgard2/) -backed provider of the [PHP Content Repository](http://phpcr.github.com/) (PHPCR) interfaces. `phpcr-midgard2` is a [Symfony CMF](http://cmf.symfony.com/) compatible PHPCR provider that can be used in PHP Content Management Systems without requiring Java.

Using Midgard2 instead of [Apache Jackrabbit](http://jackrabbit.apache.org/) also has the benefit of making interoperability with regular relational databases used by many CMSs easy. Midgard2 supports [multiple databases](http://www.gnome-db.org/Providers_status), including MySQL, Postgres, and SQLite.

Each node type gets its own table, with the tree structure managed separately in the database. This makes it easy to map existing relational databases into the PHPCR tree.
